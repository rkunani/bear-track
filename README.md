# BearTrack

This web app allows Berkeley students to "follow" the status of classes they are interested in. For example, a student can get a text when a spot in a class they are interested in opens up.

The app is deployed at [tinyurl.com/beartrackapp](https://tinyurl.com/beartrackapp). Unfortunately, the API I was using to get class enrollment data has been discontinued.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.
